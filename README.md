# github-report

##### Finished a TypeScript online course and built this app to gain some practice.
A simple command line utility to collect some essential github user data.
- By a given Github username, the utility collects the data from the Github REST API
  and maps it to the corresponding "Repo" and "User" classes.
#### Directory contents:
  - src - The TypeScript (.ts) files
  - out - The JavaScript (.js) files
